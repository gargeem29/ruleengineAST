# Rule Evaluation System

This project implements a rule evaluation engine that processes logical and comparison rules, creating an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for evaluation based on given data. The engine supports basic boolean logic, string comparisons, and numerical evaluations.

## Features

- Tokenizes rule strings to identify numbers, strings, boolean literals, identifiers, operators, and logical operators.
- Constructs an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from the tokenized input.
- Evaluates rules against provided data, returning boolean results.
- Supports logical operations (`AND`, `OR`) and various comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`).
